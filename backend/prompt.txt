Using the following requirements, create a JSON object from the following workout description:

{wod_description}

1. Include a list of **main muscle groups** with percentage contributions to each muscle group based on typical biomechanics. The main muscle groups to include are:
   - Chest
   - Back
   - Shoulders
   - Biceps
   - Triceps
   - Forearms
   - Core
   - Quadriceps
   - Hamstrings
   - Glutes
   - Calves
   - Hip Flexors

   - Upper-body pushing
   - Squatting
   - Hip hinging
   - Rotational
   - Locomotion
   - Lunging
   - Carrying
   - Jumping/Explosive
   - Isometric holds

Return the data in the following JSON structure:
